# PyBer_Analysis and Business Proposal

#Overview of Analysis
Our analysis was  aimed at assisting PyBer, a ride-sharing company, to better understand their revenue along the urban-rural axis. By understanding the urban-rural classification of the city's that Pyber is active in, we sought to better visualize which cities were underserved and how we could better optimize our performance. 

#Results
We see that rural cities have far fewer rides over all, and that ride sharing is much more common in urban areas; urban areas drive a vast majority of PyBer's revenue. Average fare per ride is far highest in rural communities, suggesting that trips taken in rural cities are much longer. Notably, there are very few total drivers in the rural cities. 

#Summary
Based on this we can make the following business recommendations. 1. Recruit more drivers in rural areas; the fact that there were only 125 rides completed by 78 drivers implies that there's likely a lack of availability, but these rides when taken tend to be very lucrative for both the driver and PyBer. 2. Based on the high average price of the rural rides, it is worthwhile considering if there is some way in which pricing could be altered in less dense areas; it would appear that it's likely based off of miles traveled, which would make it very expensive in rural areas and unreasonable as the time to travel the same distance in a rural area is far lower than in an urban one. 3. Similar business actions could likely be taken in suburban markets; in essence the goal should be making the average fare per ride in these markets more similar to urban markets--this will increase revenue and increase access to ride sharing.
